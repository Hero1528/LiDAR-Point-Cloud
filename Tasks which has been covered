Dataset:

Use your own data set preferably of forest or trees

Assignment Requirements (Tasks)
1. Notebook Structure & Metadata Documentation
Create a Jupyter Notebook titled LIDAR_Visualization_Assignment.ipynb
Import and document the dataset metadata clearly, including essential properties.
Provide a summary describing what the dataset represents.

2. 2D Visualization
Generate a complete 2D visualization section containing:
A top-down projection
Color-based representation using an attribute of your choice
Interpretation of patterns observed


3. 3D Visualization
Produce a full 3D visualization of the LiDAR point cloud:
Must include color mapping based on at least one feature
Must include user-navigable perspective or verification screenshots
Include written observations comparing 2D vs 3D perspectives

4. Point Classification Segmentation
Create a segmentation section showing:
Ground vs non-ground separation
At least one additional meaningful segmentation category
A short written explanation of your segmentation criteria

5. Elevation Modeling Outputs
Develop visual outputs for:
A Digital Elevation Model (DEM)
A contour representation
A short analysis of terrain patterns observed

6. Final Report Summary
At the end of the notebook, include a concise report covering:

Key findings
Challenges encountered
Observed data quality issues
What insights LiDAR visualization can provide in real-world applications
